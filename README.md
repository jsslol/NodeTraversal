# NodeTraversal
Implements Dijkstra's,DFS, and BFS algorithims to find the shortest path from node 1 to all other nodes and draws the graphs showing the paths taken.

The text files are organized as follows:
• First line of the file is the number of vertices.
• Each other line is a list of integers separated by spaces.
• The first number in these lines is the name of the vertex.
• The remaining numbers in these lines are pairs, denoting the name of a neighbor node and the weight or distance from the vertex named by the first number of the line.
